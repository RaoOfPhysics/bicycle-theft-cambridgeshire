I Experienced two incidents like this  the first was from when I built up my dream bike with the wages I had from my first ever job (spent £700+). 17 hours after putting the last bit on  I was riding my bike at a skatepark in gloucester when I was mugged for it.  	The police did turn up  to my surprise  and took some details. later on  a guy came to the skatepark and said he saw this guy riding a good looking bike around  that he knew wasn't his  and described it to me  it was mine! He knew the thief from dating his sister  but hated the kid  so told me the guys name.  	I immediately phoned the police (this being about 2 hours tops after the robbery) and told them the thief's full name  and thought that would be the deciding factor. I even found the guy on bebo.com and confirmed it was him.  	6 weeks down the line I get a phone call "Hi Philip this is ******* from Gloucester police  you said you know the guys name  what was it again?"  	Great  this could have been sorted the same day. 	I tell them  with low hopes. then 2 months later  they phone me again  stating they've phoned him up and he denies ever stealing anything. what would I Like to do now...  	The second instance is actually with this page  where badgering might be the way forward! I spotted a stolen bike opposite where I work  it is there every day and the theif just sits on it and bounces on the suspension whilst he tries to sell drugs. he's there without fail! I got in touch with the owner  and with the police myself  and so did he. I contacted him every time I was at work  and the bike was there  and he contacted the police each time. nothing. I obviously don't want to steal the bike back  since the last person I want to be on the bad side of is a drug dealer who I'm in plain sight of every day when I work  and the owner feels the same. It's not safe! The worst thing is we phone the police almost every day saying this guy and his pals stand outside our venue selling drugs to our customers  we have them on CCTV. they stand in front of it!  	I'm not sure what we can do except become our own police force for bikes. it is a devastating crime. In south africa  the community tie up and burn any thieves since the police don't make arrests  so a simple unofficial police force  tracking down and repossessing stolen bikes wouldn't even be that extreme.  	anyway I've had my rant  great blog post  and great site. hopefully it's reclaimed many a stolen bike  with many more to come.  	Sadly none of this surprises me at all  i'm only commenting out of my own incredulity  I'm not even sure I am angry at my own story  just utterly baffled how this kind of situation became acceptable.  	One of our bikes was stolen in the week  locked to a bike rack in our town centre  under a CCTV camera whilst left for 15 minutes.  	When my other half approached a policeman to explain  he was very helpful and knew exactly which bike it was and what had happened. it had all been observed on CCTV and he had been made aware as it was happening. They had watched the whole thing  the reason they didn't take any action was because in their own words "they needed a victim".  	It would appear the town centre is very well covered with CCTV as they managed to trace his movements to well over half a mile away. Which is all good to know and thoroughly comforting that the technology works but does make you question what it is there for.   	shocking stories there  why don't the police respond to this. Sounds like a simple arrest  you have done all the donkey work  all they have got to do is turn up.  	I had a bike stolen a couple of years ago. The outcome of my story however  was a happy one. I noticed it had been taken in the morning and immediately notified the police. An officer came to my home to get a description of the bike which by the way  I'd built myself so knew every component and defect so the description was erm  comprehensive... Luckily the responding officer was also a cyclist so understood the importance of finding it. Any way the next day I was trawling the usual places  ebay  preloved the when unthinkable happens  I found my bike on Gumtree less than 5 miles away from my house... I immediately phoned the police again and asked for the officer who'd attended the day before  explained I'd found it and there was a contact number. That's when he dropped a bombshell on me. The police can not make a phone call in response to an advert to arrange a meeting because it's considered to be entrapment. So  found my bike  got the scroats number  but now what??? I started to text him about the bike. At about 6pm I got his address and phoned the cop. He assured me they'd check it out as soon as units were available and low and behold 35 minutes later he rang me back to say: I'm at the address  the bike's here  can you tell me some identifying marks? After I'd reeled off a list of things as long as your arm in 20 seconds flat he confirmed it was mine  loaded it into a waiting van and the kid was arrested. Turns out he'd bought it off a lad from my estate who was well known to the police  and was trying to make a quick flip. What pissed me off the most about the whole thing was that the kid was trying to sell my custom built cove sanchez for a poxy £50!!!   	These stories sound all too familiar. In my case I had two bikes stolen from an underground carpark in my London buiilding. I had my own CCTV footage which I gave to the police but subsequently discovered they never look at it. About three months later I saw the Frame from one of my bikes on sale on Ebay. This was a custom bike built while I was living in America and I knew every component on it. I check up on previious sales from the Ebay vendor and saw that he sold my wheels a couple of weeks earlier.  	I contacted the police with reference number from the original crime and spoke to the person who had been assigned to it. I was told there was only one person in the station who was able to contact Ebay for details of the vendor and he would be on it right away. I then waited for a response while keeping an eye on the ebay sale. The day the sale was due to end I had still heard nothing so put a bid in for the frame and won the auction. 	This was the Friday and I again contacted the police to see if someone would come with me to collect it.  	I was told in no uncertain terms not to meet with the vendor because of the risk involved and to this day never heard another word from the Police. This happened in 2013.  	My bike was off road bike was taken in the Johnstown area of Wrexham at about 20past11 Tuesday night as one of my neighbours spotted a lad running away with it and I rang police gave them all this information and they just fobbed me off so no the cheeky git gets away with a really expensive bike not happy and really annoyed by the police's response to this
